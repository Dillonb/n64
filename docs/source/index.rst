n64docs
=======

It is my hope that this document will make Nintendo 64 emulation a more approachable and accessible project for as many people as possible.

I aim to document the sharp edges I hurt myself on along the way, as well as collect as much of the information scattered around as possible into one document. Currently it is *VERY MUCH* a work in progress, and nowhere near complete.

This guide is intended to be used by emulator developers, but homebrew authors might find the information presented here useful as well.

I'm by no means the leading expert on the N64. If you have any corrections for me, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on my `GitHub repo <https://github.com/Dillonb/n64/tree/master/docs>`_.

Assumed Prior Knowledge
-----------------------

While my goal is to be as clear and accessible as possible, I expect readers to be somewhat familiar with emulation already. If you've written an emulator for a system on the level of the original Game Boy or NES, you should be fine.
